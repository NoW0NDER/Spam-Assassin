    "Given the performance metrics, logistic regression is the preferable method for classifying new observations compared to 1-nearest neighbors (1-NN). Although logistic regression exhibits a test error of 30%, suggesting some overfitting, it indicates better generalization than 1-NN, which, while achieving a 0% error on training data, likely suffers from a much higher error on the test data due to overfitting—implied by its average error rate of 18%. This average error rate is misleading as it masks the likely poor performance on unseen data, which is a critical factor in predictive modeling. Consequently, logistic regression, with its more balanced performance between training and test data, emerges as a more reliable and robust choice for classifying new observations."

    "When features in a training set exhibit very different scales, algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Logistic Regression are particularly sensitive to this issue. K-NN and SVM (using distance-based kernels like the linear or RBF kernel) depend directly on the calculation of distances between data points; hence, a feature with a larger scale can disproportionately influence the model's decisions. Similarly, Logistic Regression, which uses gradient descent for optimization, can suffer from slow convergence or convergence to suboptimal solutions if feature scales are not uniform, as gradients with respect to larger-scaled features can dominate the update steps.\n",

    "To address issues related to differing scales of features, several preprocessing techniques can be employed. Normalization or Min-Max Scaling adjusts features so that they fall within a specific range, typically [0, 1], which can prevent any single feature from overpowering others in distance-based algorithms. Standardization or Z-score normalization, which rescales data to have zero mean and unit variance, is another method that is particularly useful for algorithms involving optimization, as it ensures that each feature contributes equally to the decision process."

    "Primarily, increasing the number of estimators can help as more weak learners will provide more opportunities to correct errors, enhancing the ensemble's ability to capture complex patterns in the data. Additionally, raising the learning rate might allow the model to make more substantial updates with each new weak learner, speeding up the learning process. Adjusting the base estimator’s complexity, especially if decision trees are used, by increasing `max_depth` or decreasing `min_samples_split` and `min_samples_leaf`, can also make the individual learners more sensitive to finer details in the data. Experimenting with these adjustments while monitoring performance through cross-validation is advisable to strike a balance that mitigates underfitting without veering into overfitting."

This efficiency allows for all available data to be used in training while simultaneously performing model validation, which is particularly beneficial in data-scarce environments.

    "In ensemble learning, hard and soft voting classifiers represent two different methods of aggregating the predictions from a group of individual classifiers to form a final output classification. Hard voting counts the most frequent prediction from the classifiers as the final prediction, essentially using a majority rule without considering the confidence of each classifier's prediction. Soft voting, by contrast, leverages the probability estimates for each class provided by the classifiers, typically averaging these probabilities to determine the final prediction. This method can weigh votes based on the confidence of each classifier, potentially leading to more accurate predictions, especially when some classifiers are more reliable than others. Thus, while hard voting focuses strictly on the most common outcome, soft voting provides a nuanced approach that considers both the outcome and the certainty of each classifier's decision.\n"

Like Bryan Hoch, the webmaster, I also run websites as a labor of love, and know there isn't generally a whole lot of money left over after you pay for bandwidth. I totally believe Hoch, a college student, when he says he isn't making money. The site clearly disclaims that it is not representative of the Mets or Major League Baseball. If you go HYPERLINK deeper  you see that Hoch contributed his time for free to help the Mets improve their own site, before all sites were taken over by MLB in 2001 (what a bad idea, why can't teams differentiate themselves based on the quality of their community sites). Now of course there's another side to it, so let's keep an open mind.

      "ongoing project to port Windows applications to Linux. It's a tough goal, but\n",
      "it's also one that's been undertaken by HYPERLINK others  in the past year or so. Though the progress has been\n",
      "slow, the Wine project has managed to stay at the front of this development\n",
      "realm.\n",
      "HYPERLINK CrossOver\n",
      "Plugin  marks a change in the philosophy of the Wine Project. Prior to its\n",
      "release, Wine had taken a \"full system\" approach. Running Windows applications\n",
      "in Wine required the installation of a sizeable daemon and no small amount of\n",
      "configuration work. CrossOver Plugin has moved Wine away from the system-wide\n",
      "approach to one that's much more modular. Rather than executing at system\n",
      "startup, Wine is called as-needed, with the virtual Windows path to the called\n",
      "program. When the program is closed, so is Wine. CrossOver Plugin has focused on\n",
      "creating Linux functionality with  one  related set of Windows\n",
      "applications: browser plugins.\n",
      "The results stand as a clear indication that the change in philosophy is a\n",
      "success. Off the top, CrossOver Plugin bundles QuickTime 5, Windows Media Player\n",
      "6.2, Shockwave 8.5, Flash 6, and RealPlayer 8 into a Linux-accesible browser\n",
      "plugin package. Throw in more esoteric apps like IPix, Trillian, Authorware Web\n",
      "Player 6 and eFax Messenger 2, and you've got virtually every need plugin need\n",
      "covered.\n",
      "But this package doesn't stop there. Included in the CrossOver Plugin package\n",
      "are viewers for Word, Excel and Powerpoint, as well as several\n",
      "Microsoft-oriented fonts. Honestly, I was stunned at the range of applications\n",
      "offered by the CodeWeavers developers.\n",
      "Having had some experience with Wine, I was a bit leery about the install\n",
      "process and about the ability to get all these great applications to work with\n",
      "my RedHat setup. I've never been completely successful with Wine, but I hoped\n",
      "for the best when I started the CrossOver Plugin installation. I really did want\n",
      "these apps to work.\n",
      "The installation was quite easy. By running the install-crossover.sh script from\n",
      "the command line, I was able to install the installers for both CrossOver Plugin\n",
      "and CrossOver Office, which we'll talk about tomorrow. I started the plugin\n",
      "installs with QuickTime, a tool I've admittedly missed in Linux. In the\n",
      "background, CrossOver Plugin had already created a virtual C:\\ drive on my\n",
      "machine. I clicked on the QuickTime install and immediately saw a familiar sight\n",
      "- the Vise installer in its Windows format. CrossOver Plugin first checked for\n",
      "feedback from the Windows binary, opened a virtual Windows window, then stepped\n",
      "out while the Vise installer took care of the rest. Though the install failed\n",
      "four times, it appeared to be a server failure rather than a failure of the\n",
      "CrossOver program. I kept \"retry\"ing and, with some persistence, managed to get\n",
      "a full QuickTime 5 install downloaded from the Apple servers. Quite literally,\n",
      "the install looked and performed exactly as I've seem many times in Windows.\n",
      "When the install was completed, CrossOver again checked for the Windows binary,\n",
      "located the appropriate .dll files in the virtual C:\\ drive and dropped the\n",
      "plugins into the /home/tony/.netscape/plugins and /home/tony/.mozilla/plugins\n",
      "directories.\n",
      "The process was so smooth that I had to check the plugin listings in these\n",
      "browsers - \"Help\", \"About Plugins.\" Sure enough, the CrossOver QuickTime plugin\n",
      "was listed. Quickly, I ran out to the Apple site and opened the \"Men In Black\n",
      "II\" movie trailer. QuickTime performed flawlessly.\n",
      "I followed with the Windows Media Player, Shockwave, Flash, IPix, and eFax\n",
      "Messenger installs. Of those, the only ones that weren't self-contained in the\n",

      "a half-hour, I had all installed and tested.\n",
      "Then, just for grins, I installed RealPlayer 8 via CrossOver. This was despite\n",

      "smoothly as the others with one caveat - the player played media files at a much\n",

But occasionally I hit a site that has features that don't work or has a messed up layout, so I have to launch IE to view it correctly. In the last couple of years, Web builders have used HYPERLINK proprietary code  from Microsoft in their sites, which Mozilla and Opera don't support.\n",
      "I used to cover Web building, so I have plenty of insight into the problem. Using current, standard HTML and JavaScript, Web builders can make a Web site do almost anything that you could with Microsoft's proprietary code. The only things they can't do are goofy enhancements such as changing the browser scroll bar colors. To solve this compatibility problem, either Web builders have to take proprietary tags out of their sites or users have to use IE to view them. You can also enhance IE with utilities such as HYPERLINK Secure IE  to get the kinds of features offered by Mozilla and Opera, giving you the best of both worlds.\n",

      "When reviewing the Toshiba Pocket PC e740, I spent a lot of time trying to understand its XScale processor. A benchmark provided by Intel seems to indicate that it performs certain operations faster than previous Pocket PCs, but in hands-on use we didn't find any significant difference in performance. I'm still not certain whether I should attribute performance limitation to the operating system (which hasn't been optimized for the new chips), applications (which likewise haven't be optimized), or simply that the new chip isn't that much better than the old StrongARM. But regardless, the e740 is an exceptional Pocket PC and one I don't hesitate to recommend to those looking for a high-powered PDA.\n",

      "First, the search is underway for the hosting solution mentioned in Monday's Penguin Shell. The response has been great, with more than two dozen offers of web space for the Foundation for Children and Youth With Diabetes. It gratifying to see our community rally around a great cause. Know that whether you answered the call or not, you're in the electronic company of some caring and compassionate folks. I've not yet heard whether a solution has been found from among the many offered, but I'll certainly keep you posted on the outcome.\n",
      "Second, a few final clarifications on the 4th of July bruhaha. A reader brought to my attention that, though he didn't believe it to be the case, offering my opinion on the state of America could be seen as trolling. That certainly wasn't intended. Also, I've seen much email over the past week that started with, \"Since you published the opinion of someone outside the US, I'd expect that you'll publish an opinion in disagreement.\" Well, I did that already - it was my own opinion that started the discussion. I can clearly see the potential for this to get out of hand. So, this will be the last word on the subject. Thanks for your opinions and your discussion, the vast majority of which was well-thought and reasonable. Both sides were presented and we're moving on.\n",

      " Windows Apps in Linux? - Part II\n",
      "I don't want to mince any words, here. HYPERLINK CodeWeavers  has really hit a sweet spot with their recently-released HYPERLINK CrossOver Office  product. This is, quite simply, the fulfillment of the promise of the HYPERLINK Wine Project . Using this slick little app, virtually all the applications in the Microsoft Office suite are fully functional in Linux. Frankly, I never thought I'd see the day when running Windows apps in Linux was exciting. Maybe it's time to take up shucking ice cubes in the blasted lands.\n",
      "Let's break this product up a bit. If purchased as a bundle, both CrossOver Office and HYPERLINK CrossOver Plugin  (as we discussed yesterday) share an install script. They do, however, require separate install processes, so they need to be launched individually from a shared window.\n",
      "I started the CrossOver Office install, dropped my Office 2000 disc in the CD drive, and fired up the install. It looked and performed exactly as you'd expect to see it in Windows. I was able to customize the install, as I always have, then let it run. At the end of the process, CrossOver Office \"fakes\" a Windows reboot and the Office suite installation is complete.\n",
      "Even Internet Explorer 5.0 is installed. There's an option in the CrossOver Office package to install IE 5.5 but, to my chagrin, this was the one area of the install that failed. Actually, the install itself may have succeeded - I was just left without an IE browser following the upgrade. It's hard to tell whether that was a fault in CrossOver Office, or in the IE program itself.\n",
      "For the most part, these apps perform in Linux as they do in Windows. The IE install was a bit kludgy, with some font problems and an inability to customize the toolbar. Word worked perfectly, allowing me even to pull together legal documents for a friend's business without so much as a hiccup. Even printing works well with the installation of a \"Wine Postscript Printer\" driver.\n",
      "Let me reiterate something I said yesterday. I've watched the Wine Project walk, then crawl, then walk again over the past few years. I've always suspected that the fits and starts were not for lack of talent. With the financial backing of CodeWeavers, it appears that my suspicions were well founded. Wine has, through CrossOver Office and CrossOver Plugin, matured to a level of useability that should easily attract Linux users throughout the spectrum of experience. In the big picture, widespread acceptance of these products could remove the last remaining roadblock for many current Windows users to make the leap to Linux: the loss of Word and Excel. They simply don't need to fear those losses any more.\n",
      "A note on the \"for pay\" structure of these products seems in order. As you well know, I'm an open source guy through and through. But, this is clearly a case in which the \"free\" efforts of talented and dedicated developers simply wasn't enough to close the gap. The value of these products easily outweighs their minimal cost. And, if it keeps these developers moving forward, it seems to be the perfect pay model for Linux.\n",

      " Kernel Configuration - Part X\n",
      "Today we're looking into the mysteries of Plug and Play support in your Linux kernel configuration.\n",
      "There's really not much mystery to it. This section simply asks the question, \"Do you want plug and play support in the kernel?\" In other words, do you have all the PCI and ISA devices in your system that you'll ever need to have? If you're set solid with your current machine, there's no use to add the overhead of PnP to your system's kernel code, or as a loadable module. If, on the other hand, you've got PCI or (on an older system) ISA slots just begging to be filled, build this support into the kernel or select it as modules.\n",
      "See, this kernel gig isn't really so tough. In fairness, we're hitting the high points without a heady discussion of the hidden workings. The discussion of PnP alone could comprise a full series in Penguin Shell. But, so far, the configuration has been pretty straightforward.\n",
      "Tomorrow, we  will  dive a bit deeper, with a discussion of block device kernel configuration.\n",

      "Dear Reader,\n",
      "As of Monday, July 15, AnchorDesk is being published on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, instead of five days a week. The AnchorDesk Weekly newsletter will continued to be published every Friday\n",
      "Why are we doing this? There are several reasons, but the most important one is giving me a chance do more than just sit behind a desk typing all day in order to meet deadlines.  I've been writing five columns a week for 18 months now, and I'd be lying to you if I didn't admit to being more than a little tired.\n",
      "Also, I've been on such a short leash that I haven't been able to travel or meet as many people as I'd like. This new schedule means I'll have more time to get out, learn more, see more products, and discover new issues or trends. So it should result in a more interesting and useful AnchorDesk for you.\n",
      "Having additional time also means I will be able to work on several projects I've been assigned, including one that could bear fruit at the Consumer Electronics Show next January. More about that soon, once all the details are nailed down.\n",
      "For now, the new schedule is being called a \"test,\" which means it could turn out to be temporary--or maybe not. We'll run it through the end of the summer and see how it works.\n",
      "I appreciate your continued support of AnchorDesk. While the column will be less frequent, I will still be on HYPERLINK CNET Radio  every weekday at noon PT (or on-demand streaming anytime) and hope you will join me there.\n",

      "We've talked about the different types of devices in previous Penguin Shell\n",
      "issues. Fundamentally, the two that you'll deal with the most are block and\n",
      "character devices. These draw their type names from the way they handle data.\n",
      "Block devices receive data for storage in chunks, generally pre-set sizes of\n",
      "data \"blocks.\" Hard drives are block devices. They'll only write chunks of data\n",
      "to storage. Thus, the problem with shutting down your machine uncleanly. Data\n",
      "intended for storage may not, in fact, have been written at the time your power\n",
      "dies or you hard kill your machine. The system may still be accumulating data up\n",
      "to the proper block size before committing it to the hard drive.\n",
      "Character devices, on the other hand, receive data in \"streams,\" one character\n",
      "at a time. Serial ports are a great example of character devices. They handle\n",
      "data input and output on the fly, rather than filling a buffer  then\n",
      "committing the data.\n",
      "The physical nature of these device types goes a long way toward explaining why\n",
      "they handle data as they do. A hard drive has to physically spin up to store or\n",
      "retrieve data. You're actually changing the magnetic properties of the disc\n",
      "surface when you store data. Consequently, a hard drive has to know where\n",
      "there's free space on the disc surface, has to move that area of the disc under\n",
      "the write head and try, as best it can, to group blocks of related data\n",
      "together.\n",
      "Character devices really don't store data as much as they send it off and forget\n",
      "about it. The process is purely electrical rather than electrical and physical.\n",
      "The serial port, for example, sends data in a stream to your Palm Pilot. The\n",
      "storage of the data is actually handled by the Palm itself, not a physical\n",
      "storage device on the computer. There's no need to spin up a drive and account\n",
      "for the data as is necessary with a hard drive. The Palm will also send a signal\n",
      "back to the computer confirming receipt of data. That's an indication that\n",
      "character devices often communicate in both directions, as well.\n",
      "So, when you're configuring block devices in your kernel, you're preparing the\n",
      "system for communicating with a device that will buffer data to a predetermined\n",
      "level, then write that data as a block, changing the physical properties of the\n",

He also notes Power Integrations is expanding its market with DC-to-DC power supply products, and says the firm's growth is based on converting today's power supplies to its more efficient technologies. As a result, the company doesn't need a boost in end-market demand to grow, Lee says. Although he sees a large, untapped market for Power Integrations and likes its long-term prospects, Lee suggests the stock is fairly valued.

If you aren't as much of a fan of keyboard shortcuts as me, then all you have to do is press and hold the Ctrl key while clicking on the Maximize button and you will have the same effect. You will notice, however, that your Start Menu isn't anywhere to be seen.

      "I never thought I’d say it, but I’m changing my tune about subscription music services.\n",
      "When MusicNet and Pressplay launched their monthly subscription services late last year, I was unimpressed. Their music catalogs were limited, the software was clunky, and the copyright protection features seemed unduly restrictive. I wondered how they could ever compete with the seductive (read: free) charms of file sharing. But last week I decided to try out Listen.com’s HYPERLINK Rhapsody , a subscription streaming music service that recently managed to secure recordings from all five major labels. And now I’m rethinking my stance.\n",
      "Rhapsody is not for everyone. If you like to burn your MP3s to CD or download them to a portable player, you’ll want to look elsewhere; Rhapsody allows CD burning only for a small portion of its catalog, and only for an extra charge, and you can’t download MP3s at all. But what Rhapsody does have is music, and lots of it--thousands of albums of all major genres on demand as well as tons of preprogrammed radio stations. I think Listen.com might be onto something with its streaming service. Would you pay 10 bucks a month for a service that has all the music you could ask for, but won't allow you to actually download MP3s? Let me know at HYPERLINK edit@download.com\n",

      "   \"Web builders should be doing as much as possible to support the broadest possible usage by their target audience\"\n",
      "A little over half the responses put the onus of compatibility on builders.\n",
      "   \"There are far less browser makers than there are Web builders and users. So it doesn't make sense for users or Web builders to do that job does it?.\"\n",
      "After Web builders, browser manufacturers got the most blame, although this response makes the best argument.\n",
      "   \"The ordinary users are one group most at fault since they tend to stick to only one browser.\"\n",
      "Few responses said users should take responsibility, as most respondents fall into the Web user category.\n",
      "   \"As a professional designer, I say proprietary code is downright evil, no matter who it comes from--and no matter what nifty trick it does.\"\n",
      "Quite a number of Web builders wrote in, with many taking responsibility while noting the difficulty of testing in every browser.\n",
      "   \"Because Web pages are viewed 90 percent of the time by IE it is understandable that the time spent to make a site compatible with the remaining tiny minority has to be justified.\"\n",
      "A few responses quoted server logs, making the point that it's not cost efficient to make sites compatible for people who choose a low-market share browser.\n",

And even after Nvidia--which began to chip away at ATI's leading spot in graphics in 1999--comes out with its GeForce 5 in a few months, the competition between the two will remain close.\n",

      "Adapted Play - 131min\n",
      "Reviewer's Tilt (10)\n",
      "Before directing Catch-22 and The Graduate, Mike Nichols made his big screen debut directing this adroit adaptation of Edward Albee's play \"Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?\"  Nominated for thirteen, and winner of five, Academy Awards, this dark tale centers on history professor George (Richard Burton), and his wife Martha (Elizabeth Taylor), daughter of the college president.  At first George and Martha appear to be the average Ozzie and Harriet, an aging, well-adjusted, educated couple, comfortable with their lives and their love.  George and Martha quickly shatter this illusion, as they return from a faculty cocktail party, to exchange a caustic barrage of verbal barbs.  Just as quickly, however, the couple turns witty and civil when the young new biology professor Nick (George Segal) and his shy, but pretty wife Honey (Sandy Dennis) stop by for a nightcap. Unfortunately for Nick and Honey, the sardonic exchange does not disappear, it merely changed guise.  Soon Nick and Honey find themselves helpless pawns in the elder couple's sick-witted exchange.  Throughout the remainder of the movie, George and Martha dance their finely choreographed, oft-rehearsed dance of despise. The two alternate the lead, alternately dishing out and enabling the abuse, but they never miss a step.  Thankfully, writer Albee's sublime play translates to the big screen almost unadulterated. Taylor and Burton deliver his lines with great force and impeccable timing.  At one point George proposes \"Now that we're through with Humiliate the Host...and we don't want to play Hump the Hostess yet...how about a little round of Get the Guests?\"  This provides some idea of the precarious twist of uncomfortable wit that drives the action from start to finish. Albee's stellar writing notwithstanding, the real star of this film is Taylor and Burton's alchemy, converting Albee's words into cinematic gold.  Ok, I will grant you that playing a pair of aging, drunk, selfish lovers may not have been much of a stretch.  Both actors, however, deliver their lines with the chilling reality of a serial killer describing his most gratifying slaying.  Often unpleasant and disturbing, this film never allows you to relax or look away.   Simultaneously seamlessly smooth, and ingeniously rocky this is not a \"feel good\" movie. \"Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?\" is, however, a memorable film that will stick with you for years to come.\n",

      "Dear Reader,\n",
      "As of Monday, July 15, AnchorDesk is being published on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, instead of five days a week. The AnchorDesk Weekly newsletter will continued to be published every Friday\n",
      "Why are we doing this? There are several reasons, but the most important one is giving me a chance do more than just sit behind a desk typing all day in order to meet deadlines.  I've been writing five columns a week for 18 months now, and I'd be lying to you if I didn't admit to being more than a little tired.\n",
      "Also, I've been on such a short leash that I haven't been able to travel or meet as many people as I'd like. This new schedule means I'll have more time to get out, learn more, see more products, and discover new issues or trends. So it should result in a more interesting and useful AnchorDesk for you.\n",
      "Having additional time also means I will be able to work on several projects I've been assigned, including one that could bear fruit at the Consumer Electronics Show next January. More about that soon, once all the details are nailed down.\n",
      "For now, the new schedule is being called a \"test,\" which means it could turn out to be temporary--or maybe not. We'll run it through the end of the summer and see how it works.\n",
      "I appreciate your continued support of AnchorDesk. While the column will be less frequent, I will still be on HYPERLINK CNET Radio  every weekday at noon PT (or on-demand streaming anytime) and hope you will join me there.\n",

      "First, we'd really like to see you in August. I know that Jake, Chris and Randy have been signing off on their newsletters with those few words, and I'll join them. If you didn't experience HYPERLINK Gnomedex  last year, you missed, in the words of many industry insiders, \"The show of the year.\" It was unlike any other computer conference I've ever attended. Unlike any conference I've attended, period, computer-related or not. While most such conferences are a huge hustle and hassle, Gnomedex was what computing and Lockergnome are all about - sharing useful information, gathering with like-minded enthusiasts, and learning to use your chosen computer to the fullest extent. No hustle. No hassle. No BS. For the minimal cost of HYPERLINK registration , it would be hard to find a better weekend for geeks and wannabes alike. Add to that the schedule of luminaries presenting and attending and you've got the best deal on the planet for computer users. It's hard to believe we're less than a month away - I really do hope to see you there.\n",
      "Another Lockergnome innovation has hit the newsstands - err, bookstores. That's right. HYPERLINK Jake  has release a  FREE  HYPERLINK GnomeTome  on \"Converting Vinyl LPs to CD.\" Who'd have thought there were so many of you out there that are, well, my age and still in possession of those black slabs of aural heaven. I don't know if Jake's just lost his mind, or what, but free? Get outta here. Go ahead - \"Gnome\" our servers. Get you copy while you can. And while you're there, check out some of the other killer e-tip books in the GnomeTomes collection.\n",

      " Setting the Home Page in Konqueror\n",
      "Konqueror, while a great browser, has taken a step in the direction of IE. Like IE, Konqueror is really an integrated web  and  file browser. You can use it equally well to view web pages and files on your system. It's been something of a hot debate whether this is actually the proper use of a browser. In fact, Galeon was written specifically to answer this question - it's a web browser and a web broswer only.\n",
      "Regardless, it can be a bit annoying to punch the Home button on the Konqueror browser and end up in your /home/ user  directory. Have no fear, though. It's an easy change to make your actual web home page the home page in Konqueror.\n",
      "Open Konqueror and select Settings from the toolbar. Select \"Configure Konqueror,\" and leave the default selection of \"File Manager\" as is. In the text box on the right half of the screen, you'll see a tilde in the \"Home URL\" text box. That just tells Konqueror to use the user's home directory as the home URL. Changing this to a web address will set that address as your home page. Select OK to close the window.\n",
      "Taking it one step further, click on the Home button in your Konqueror browser to open your newly-configured web home page. Then, select \"Window\" and \"Save View Profile, 'Web Browsing.'\" This will futher save the URL and allow your the opportunity to save the window size when the browser opens.\n",
      "Konqueror is more than just a web browser. But, it's not so tough to make it act like a pure web browser if you just know where to look.\n",

      " Kernel Configuration - Part XII\n",
      "Depending on who you talk to, RAID can stand for \"Redundant Array of Independent Discs\" or \"Redundant Array of Inexpensive Discs.\" No matter. They both point to the same theory and practice in Linux; data storage redundancy. That's today's kernel configuration section - Multi-Device Support.\n",
      "Let's talk first about the principles behind a RAID setup. RAID uses multiple discs for speed, increased data storage, or data redundancy. Fundamentally, there are 5 levels of RAID in Linux; Linear, RAID-0, RAID-1, RAID-4, and RAID-5.\n",
      "Linear RAID uses two or more discs, appending data from one to another. In other words, when disc 1 is full, disc 2 steps in to store data. There is no redundancy in Linear RAID - only an increase in storage capacity. Further, there's no marked increase in data access speed because you're accessing one drive in the RAID array at a time.\n",
      "RAID-0 \"stripes\" data across the RAID drives. Some data will be written to the first drive, some to the second, etc. Like Linear RAID, RAID-0 provides no redundancy. Because the data has been written in parallel across the drives, not all data exists on all drives. Lose a drive and your data is gone. RAID-0 will, however, decrease data access time. Your system will run more quickly.\n",
      "RAID-1, unlike Linear and RAID-0,  does  provide data redundancy. This is the first level in which data is \"mirrored\" across the drives in the RAID array. All data that exists on one drive exists on all the others. RAID-1 requires at least two drives and they should be of equal size, otherwise, your overall RAID array will be the size of the smallest drive. Performance with RAID-1 can actually be slower than with a single drive or RAID-0, as all the data is written across multiple discs.\n",
      "RAID-4 is, for the most part, pretty useless. It reserves one disc for HYPERLINK parity  information while striping the data across the others. This is much like Linear mode, with an additional disc thrown in for parity data. Parity data  can  be used to reconstruct and retrieve the data on the other drives, but this really isn't a redundant method of data storage. Consequently, RAID-4 is probably the least used of the RAID schemes.\n",
      "RAID-5 is designed for 3 or more discs and provides both redundancy and speed. Like RAID-4, RAID-5 pays close attention to parity data. However, rather than reserving a device in the RAID array for this data, it's written across the array. Because the parity data is written across the array, data recovery can be accomplished fairly quickly. In fact, using a \"spare disc\" configuration will allow RAID-5 to reconstruct the data to the spare disc immediately after the failure of a drive. Because of it's increased speed and redundancy, RAID-5 is probably the most common setup for multiple storage devices.\n",
      "With all that in mind, you'll need to make a choice in your kernel configuration. Do you have mutliple drives of the same size that you'd like to configure as a RAID array? The Multi-Device Support section of the kernel configuration will allow you to do this. In fact, you'll be able to set the RAID level, as well. Again, evaluate your needs and select the appropriate option.\n",
      "Tomorrow, it's on to networking options in your kernel configuration.\n",

      "{Startup manager} This application bills itself as \"Yet Another Startup Manager\"... I don't think so! Starter isn't JUST another Startup Manager, it's a piece of programming art. One of my biggest problems with Windows Task Manager is that I don't know what all the processes on my machine are, or from where they are running. Starter not only gives me that information, but it also lets me save it as an HTML file. In addition, Starter lets me import and export registry keys or add a new task to be processed. Don't run all over your machine trying to find all the programs you need to control your PC, when you can do it all (and more!) with Starter.\n",

Aversoft Sticker is a program to help you remember \"important information by displaying skinnable sticky notes on your Windows desktop.\" No more bland notes for me! With Sticker, I am surrounded with pictures of paradise (downloaded from Aversoft's website). These great features are no accident. Sticker also has a transparency feature that makes the notes only half visible, making it much easier to use while working on your other programs. Don't walk away yet though... Sticker also allows you to print your notes, lock them from accidentally being deleted, and set an alarm (repeating or one-time). Speaking of alarms, mine just went off and opened up Outlook.

      "Gnomies are known for their willingness to help others and Alex Warren is no exception with a tip on copying text. Alex writes: \"Did you know that you can copy the contents of a message/dialog box just by pressing Ctrl+C?\" Alex also had this to say: \"When you select text and then use the mouse to drag it to a new location, the original text moves to the new location and disappears from the old location. However, you can select text and then use the right mouse button to drag it to a new location. When you do this, releasing the right mouse button opens a menu from which you can choose to move or copy the text (along with several other options).\" Those are some great time saving tips Alex! Following suit with using Ctrl + C to copy... you can also use Ctrl + X to cut and Ctrl + V to paste. You can also use all these tips on more then just text! The next time you need to copy some files on your PC, try the right-click and drag method and you will see what I mean... along with saving yourself some time.\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t\t I'm sure you've seen those annoying X-10 cameras ads popping up left and right while surfing the Internet. One day, out of curiosity, I decided to check this bothersome company's Web site. To my amazement, I found that their miniature cameras are pretty darn tiny, and you can mount them practically anywhere. But what does the law says about using them? I wouldn't want anyone to invade my privacy with that sort of camera setup. Coincidentally, I ran across this interesting discussion about this in the Boards, where members were discussing these HYPERLINK miniature cameras , called CCTVs, and the privacy concerns around them. So if you want more info or would like to leave your two cents' worth about this, send us a post. Besides, this information might keep you from getting caught on camera in an embarrassing situation.\n",

      "   How to Publish Your Windows XP FTP Server to the Internet\n",
      "Several of you wrote in about last week's article on installing an FTP Server. You said \"that was great, but you only told half the story\". You wanted to know two more things:\n",
      " How to make the FTP Server available to Internet users\n",
      " How to secure the FTP Server\n",
      "There are several ways to make an FTP server on the internal network available to users on the Internet. These methods are referred to as \"Server Publishing\". You can use a Windows XP computer running Internet Connection Services (ICS) to publish a server on your internal network.\n",
      "Let's take a look at a common scenario. You have a Windows XP computer connected to the Internet with an always-on cable or DSL connection. You have another computer on your private network also running Windows XP. You've installed the FTP Server on this internal network computer and put files into the FTP folder. Now you want Internet users to connect to the FTP Server through the ICS computer directly connected to the Internet.\n",
      "You can do this with the Windows XP ICS! Here's how:\n",
      " Go into the Network Connections window. You can get there from the Network applet in the Control Panel.\n",
      " Right click the network interface directly connected to the Internet and click Properties.\n",
      " Click on the Advanced tab in the connection's Properties dialog box. Put a checkmark in the Internet Connection Firewall checkbox. Always make sure the Internet Connection Firewall (ICF) is enabled when you connect a computer directly to the Internet.\n",
      " Click the Settings button, then click on the Services tab in the Advanced Settings dialog box.\n",
      " Now click the Add button. This brings up the Service Settings dialog box. Type in My FTP Server in the Description of service text box. In the Name or IP address text box, type in the IP address of the computer on your private network that's running the FTP server. Since you're using ICS, it'll have an IP address like 192.168.0.x, where x is different for each machine on your network. You might want to manually assign the IP address the FTP Server already has, so that it doesn't change in the future. You can find out what IP address your FTP server is using by opening a command prompt at the FTP server and typing in the command ipconfig. That will give you the IP address the FTP Server is using. Back to the Service Settings dialog box, select the TCP option button. For the External Port and the Internet port, put in the port number you assigned to the FTP server on your internal network. Read this week's How To section to see how to change the listening port number. Clic!\n",
      "k OK\n",
      " Click OK, and then click OK one more time! You might need to disable and enable the adapter after making the change. You can do that by right clicking the always-on interface.\n",
      "The procedure is very similar for dial-up connections. However, there are problems with dial-up connections (and many always-on connections) because the IP address on the external interface of the ICS computer changes over time. Next week I'll share with you a cool way you can get around this problem by using something called a \"dynamic DNS service\". I've used one for years, and it works great. Make sure to tune in next week for the details.\n",
      "There you have it. Is server publishing in your future? Have any questions on the method I described above? If so, let me know! There are lots of ways you can publish services. Tell me how you do it, and tricks you've learned along the way. If you're having problems with server publishing, let me know about those too! I'll be sure to include what I learn from you in upcoming newsletters.\n",
      "Until next week,\n",

      "Do you use a dial-up connection but can't get your machine to synchronize its clock with an Internet time server when the Internet Connection Firewall (ICF) is enabled? If so, here's a tip Richard Surry sent in on how to fix the problem:\n",
      " Open your Network Connections window from the start menu.\n",
      " Right click on your modem (or other dial-up connection) and click Properties.\n",
      " Click on the Advanced tab. You already have a checkmark in the box that enables the ICF. Click on the Settings button.\n",
      " Click on the Services tab, then click on the Add button in the Services tab.\n",
      " That should open the Service Settings dialog box. In the Description box, put in Internet Time Service. For the Name or IP address of the computer hosting this service on your network, type in 127.0.0.1. Select the TCP  protocol option button. For both the external and internal port numbers, type 123.\n",
      " If you're online, disconnect and reconnect. Now synchronize the time by double click on the clock in the system tray and going to the Internet Time tab.\n",
      "This is an interesting tip, and it represents an even more interesting problem. For you network geeks out there, I'll ask you this question: Why should we allow unsolicited inbound connections for the Internet Time Service? The ICF should not block responses to solicited outbound connections, so why should we have to enable reverse NAT to make this work?\n",

      "   \n",
      "   How to Secure an FTP Server on Windows XP Professional\n",
      "Last week we went over how to install the Windows XP FTP Server. It will work fine after going through the steps outlined last week, but several of you asked for more information on how to secure the FTP Server because you wanted to connect it to the Internet. It's a very good idea to understand how FTP security works before putting the server on the Internet. Here are some suggestions:\n",
      " Open the Internet Information Services console from the Administrative Tools menu. In the left pane of the console, expand your server name and then expand the FTP Sites node.\n",
      " Right click on the Default FTP Site and click the Properties command.\n",
      " Click on the FTP Site tab. Notice that the default TCP Port is set to 21. This is the well-known port for FTP. You can increase security a bit by changing this port to another value that's in the 1026-65534 range. This secures it from poorly motivated click-kiddies and also allows you to get around your ISP blocking incoming connections to TCP port 21. Friends who connect to your FTP server will need to change the port number on their FTP client software as well.\n",
      " The Windows XP FTP server has a hard coded limit of 10 simultaneous connections. You might want to change this to a lower number to reduce the chance of a LAN party on the external interface of the FTP server.\n",
      " Put a checkmark in the Enable Logging checkbox. Click the Properties button to the right of the log format drop-down list box. Click the Daily option button on the General Properties tab. On the Extended Properties tab, select all of the Extended Properties. Click OK.\n",
      " Click on the Security Accounts tab. Place a checkmark in the Allow only anonymous connections checkbox. This prevents users from sending username and password credentials to the FTP server. You don't want users to send credentials because those credentials are sent in \"clear text\", which can be read by anyone who's listening on the wire.\n",
      " Click the Messages tab. Enter a Welcome message, an Exit message, and a message users will see if there are no available connections.\n",
      " Click on the Home Directory tab. Make sure there is a checkmark in the Read and Log Visits checkboxes. REMOVE the checkmark in the Write checkbox. Note the location in the Local Path text box. Navigate to that path in the Windows Explorer.\n",
      " Right click on the FTPROOT folder and click Properties.\n",
      " Click on the Security tab. Make sure that SYSTEM has Full Control. Assign the IUSR_  account READ access only. Remove all other permissions for the IUSR account. Make sure you give Adminstrators Full Control tool. This allows you, the administrator on the FTP Server computer, to add, remove and change files in the FTPROOT folder.\n",
      "Stop and restart the FTP Server. Now your FTP server is secure and Internet bad guys won't be able to use it to distribute porno and bootlegged software.\n",

      "{Popularity contest} I never considered myself to be part of the popular crowd. But how do you really know if others consider you to be popular? Well, if you are talking about the popularity of your website (although the junior high kids are more concerned about the labels on your clothes), then all you have to do is download SEPopular. Search engines (such as Google) rank your site by determining how many people link to your site (the more people who link to your site, the better your ranking). With this investigative tool, you can see how many links to your website there are (from the perspective of five major search engines). You don't just have to check out your own website, though... all you have to do is enter the URL of a website, and out comes the TRUTH about its popularity. Another nice feature of this software is that you can import web addresses from a .txt file so that you don't have to enter each one individually. It's all about keeping up with thejoneses.com.\n",

You probably knew that your snail mail could be forwarded, but what about your e-mail? Back in the days of college e-mail accounts, every time I changed ISPs I had to send a mass e-mail to my contacts and hope they saved my new address, otherwise I could miss out on getting their correspondence. The great thing about Re-Route's service is that I don't have to worry about lost e-mails after changing ISPs. Sign up for the service, and they will take any e-mail sent to your old account and forward it to your new e-mail address. After that, Re-Route e-mails the sender to notify them of your new address. If you are with AOL, MSN, or any of their featured partners, then the first month is free. If not, then Re-Route charges a very nominal fee of ten bucks for the one month and twenty-five bucks for 3 months. Have someone else handle all my changing e-mail address need!\n",

      "Just because it is summer and bright out doesn't mean that you should stop using your flash on your digital camera. Bright sunlight creates harsh shadows that may cause you to lose detail. Don't you hate those pictures where you can only see half of someone's face because the other half is black from a shadow? Well, the cure is in front of you... use your flash during the daytime to throw a little light into those shadows. Some cameras allow you to adjust how much flash is used, also known as flash exposure compensation. If you can adjust the output of your flash, then try it at the lowest setting first. Remember, you don't want to completely get rid of the shadows because they add depth to your photo. Keep increasing your flash output until you get your desired results. Also, as an extra tip, don't forget that you can conserve battery life on your digital camera by turning on the autofocus option and turning off the LCD display.\n",

Some of the leading experts on content management solutions (those things we affectionately call blogs) will be sharing the future of blogging and how you can adapt it to both the way you do business and the way you communicate in general. Join Evan Williams and Doc Searls as they share pearls of wisdom on blogging, Linux and other open source applications that are changing our lives. If that's not enough incentive, remind the boss that THE Internet security guru, Steve Gibson, will be sharing his wisdom as well.\n",

The second game, X-Diatris, the objects can move only in two diagonal directions; the vertical drop is taken out. For the last game H-Diatris the objects can only move vertically and horizontally like most block drop games.\" I won't kid you, these games can be pretty hard, but if you are a Tetris fan, then these set of games are for you.

Brian says, \"I was able to load the program, though, and try a few of the features out. You can record an audio memo to your machine, much like an answering machine. You can also e-mail this audio memo, although I don't recommend you do that as the WAV file didn't seem to play well when I tried e-mailing it to myself (which may have been due to the microphone it was recorded with). Other than that, Modem Spy is a solid program and is a great alternative to buying a traditional answering machine... plus in most cases it is cheaper!\" Keep in mind that, for Caller ID to work, you need the Caller ID service turned on by your phone service provider.\n",

      "       GnomeTIP\n",
      "This tip is for the Windows XP users out there. \"The Windows XP operating system achieves excellent performance in part by dynamic adjustments that it makes in response to how a system is utilized. In particular, many adjustments are made when the system first runs following setup and when newly installed applications are used for the first time. These adjustments greatly influence the performance of the system. Unfortunately, the dynamic nature of Windows XP can make benchmarking more of a challenge than with previous Windows versions.\" To properly benchmark your Windows XP system, there are a few steps you should follow. The step with which we are concerned in this particular tip is letting your PC process any \"idle tasks.\" Idle tasks are tasks that your PC executes when it deems the system to be unused or idle. Some of these include file placement optimization, system restore, and done-once-after-setup work items. \"All of these 'idle tasks' are controllable by a system API in advapi32.dll, ProcessIdleTasks. The API's sole purpose is to allow benchmarks a simple way to force any pending idle tasks to be executed immediately, without having to wait a lengthy period of time. To call ProcessIdleTasks from the command line, use this syntax: Rundll32.exe advapi32.dll,ProcessIdleTasks.\" Once running, it may take up to around 15 minutes to process all of the idle tasks, and your hard drive will be active through most of it. For more steps on preparing your Windows XP machine for benchmarking, head over to the Windows Platform Development page on Benchmarking for Windows XP on Microsoft's site.\n",

      " USING ARRAYLIST AND LINKEDLIST\n",
      " ArrayList  and  LinkedList  are two  Collections  classes used for storing lists of object references. For example, you could have an  ArrayList  of Strings, or a  LinkedList  of Integers. This tip compares the performance of  ArrayList  and  LinkedList , and offers some suggestions about which of these classes is the right choice in a given situation.\n",
      "The first key point is that an  ArrayList  is backed by a primitive  Object  array. Because of that, an  ArrayList  is much faster than a  LinkedList  for random access, that is, when accessing arbitrary list elements using the  get  method. Note that the  get  method is implemented for  LinkedLists , but it requires a sequential scan from the front or back of the list. This scan is very slow. For a  LinkedList , there's no fast way to access the Nth element of the list.\n",
      "Consider the following example. Suppose you have a large list of sorted elements, either an  ArrayList  or a  LinkedList . Suppose too that you do a binary search on the list. The standard binary search algorithm starts by checking the search key against the value in the middle of the list. If the middle value is too high, then the upper half of the list is eliminated. However, if the middle value is too low, then the lower half of the list is ignored. This process continues until the key is found in the list, or until the lower bound of the search becomes greater than the upper bound.\n",
      "Here's a program that does a binary search on all the elements in an  ArrayList  or a  LinkedList :\n",
      "    import java.util.*;\n",
      "    public class ListDemo1 {\n",
      "        static final int N = 10000;\n",

      "               vals[i] = new Integer(currval);\n",
      "               currval += rn.nextInt(100) + 1;\n",
      "           }\n",
      "           values = Arrays.asList(vals);\n",

      "               }\n",
      "           }\n",

      "               \"time for LinkedList = \" +\n",
      "               timeList(new LinkedList(values)));\n",
      "       }\n",
      "    }\n",
      "The  ListDemo1  program sets up a  List  of sorted Integer values. It then adds the values to an  ArrayList  or a  LinkedList . Then  Collections.binarySearch  is used to search for each value in the\n",
      "list.\n",
      "When you run this program, you should see a result that looks something like this:\n",
      "    time for ArrayList = 31\n",
      "    time for LinkedList = 4640\n",
      " ArrayList  is about 150 times faster than  LinkedList . (Your results might differ depending on your machine characteristics, but you should see a distinct difference in the result for  ArrayList  as compared to that for  LinkedList . The same is true for the other programs in this tip.) Clearly,  LinkedList  is a bad choice in this situation. The binary search algorithm inherently uses random access, and  LinkedList  does not support fast random access. The time to do a random access in a  LinkedList  is proportional to the size of the list. By comparison, random access in an  ArrayList  has a fixed time.\n",
      "You can use the  RandomAccess  marker interface to check whether a List supports fast random access:\n",
      "    void f(List lst) {\n",
      "        if (lst instanceof RandomAccess) {\n",
      "            // supports fast random access\n",
      "        }\n",
      "    }\n",
      " ArrayList  implements the  RandomAccess  interface, and  LinkedList . does not. Note that  Collections.binarySearch  does take advantage of the  RandomAccess  property, to optimize searches.\n",
      "Do these results prove that  ArrayList  is always a better choice? Not necessarily. There are many cases where  LinkedList  does better. Also note that there are many situations where an algorithm can be implemented efficiently for  LinkedList . An example is reversing a  LinkedList  using  Collections.reverse . The internal algorithm does this, and gets reasonable performance, by using forward and backward iterators.\n",
      "Let's look at another example. Suppose you have a list of elements, and you do a lot of element inserting and deleting to the list. In this case,  LinkedList  is the better choice. To demonstrate that, consider the following \"worst case\" scenario. In this demo, a program repeatedly inserts elements at the beginning of a list. The code looks like this:\n",
      "    import java.util.*;\n",
      "    public class ListDemo2 {\n",
      "        static final int N = 50000;\n",
      "        // time how long it takes to add\n",
      "        // N objects to a list\n",
      "        static long timeList(List lst) {\n",
      "            long start = System.currentTimeMillis();\n",
      "            Object obj = new Object();\n",
      "            for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {\n",
      "                lst.add(0, obj);\n",
      "            }\n",
      "            return System.currentTimeMillis() - start;\n",
      "        }\n",
      "        public static void main(String args[]) {\n",
      "            // do timing for ArrayList\n",
      "            System.out.println(\n",
      "                \"time for ArrayList = \" +\n",
      "                timeList(new ArrayList()));\n",
      "            // do timing for LinkedList\n",
      "            System.out.println(\n",
      "                \"time for LinkedList = \" +\n",
      "                timeList(new LinkedList()));\n",
      "        }\n",
      "    }\n",
      "When you run this program, the result should look something like this:\n",
      "    time for ArrayList = 4859\n",
      "    time for LinkedList = 125\n",
      "These results are pretty much the reverse of the previous example.\n",
      "When an element is added to the beginning of an  ArrayList , all of the existing elements must be pushed back, which means a lot of expensive data movement and copying. By contrast, adding an element to the beginning of a  LinkedList  simply means allocating an internal record for the element and then adjusting a couple of links. Adding to the beginning of a  LinkedList  has fixed cost, but adding to the beginning of an  ArrayList  has a cost that's proportional to the list size.\n",
      "So far, this tip has looked at speed issues, but what about space? Let's look at some internal details of how  ArrayList  and  LinkedList  are implemented in Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition v 1.4. These details are not part of the external specification of these classes, but are illustrative of how such classes work internally.\n",
      "The  LinkedList  class has a private internal class defined like this:\n",
      "    private static class Entry {\n",
      "        Object element;\n",
      "        Entry next;\n",
      "        Entry previous;\n",
      "    }\n",
      "Each  Entry  object references a list element, along with the next and previous elements in the  LinkedList  -- in other words, a doubly-linked list. A  LinkedList  of 1000 elements will have 1000  Entry  objects linked together, referencing the actual list elements. There is significant space overhead in a  LinkedList  structure, given all these  Entry  objects.\n",
      "An  ArrayList  has a backing  Object  array to store the elements. This array starts with a capacity of 10. When the array needs to grow, the new capacity is computed as:\n",
      "    newCapacity = (oldCapacity * 3) / 2 + 1;\n",
      "Notice that the array capacity grows each time by about 50%. This means that if you have an  ArrayList  with a large number of elements, there will be a significant amount of space wasted at the end. This waste is intrinsic to the way  ArrayList  works. If there was no spare capacity, the array would have to be reallocated for each new element, and performance would suffer dramatically. Changing the growth strategy to be more aggressive (such as doubling the size at each reallocation) would result in slightly better performance, but it would waste more space.\n",
      "If you know how many elements will be in an  ArrayList , you can specify the capacity to the constructor. You can also call the  trimToSize  method after the fact to reallocate the internal array. This gets rid of the wasted space.\n",
      "So far, this discussion has assumed that either an  ArrayList  or a  LinkedList  is \"right\" for a given application. But sometimes, other choices make more sense. For example, consider the very common situation where you have a list of key/value pairs, and you would like to retrieve a value for a given key.\n",
      "You could store the pairs in an N x 2  Object  array. To find the right pair, you could do a sequential search on the key values. This approach works, and is a useful choice for very small lists (say 10 elements or less), but it doesn't scale to big lists.\n",
      "Another approach is to sort the key/value pairs by ascending key value, store the result in a pair of  ArrayLists , and then do a binary search on the keys list. This approach also works, and is very fast. Yet another approach is to not use a list structure at all, but instead use a map structure (hash table), in the form of a  HashMap .\n",

Approximately, log2(N) - 1 comparisons are required in an average successful binary search, so each binary search lookup in the  ArrayList  will take about 18 comparisons. By contrast, a properly implemented hash table typically requires only 1-3 comparisons. So you should expect the hash table to be faster in this case.\n",
      "However, binary search is still useful. For example, you might want to do a lookup in a sorted list and then find keys that are close in value to the key used for the lookup. Doing this is easy with binary search, but impossible in a hash table. Keys in a hash table are stored in apparent random order. Also, if you are concerned with worst-case performance, the binary search algorithm offers a much stronger performance guarantee than a hash table scheme. You might also consider using TreeMap for doing lookups in sorted collections of key/value pairs.\n",
      "Let's summarize the key points presented in this tip:\n",
      "   Appending elements to the end of a list has a fixed averaged cost for both  ArrayList  and  LinkedList.  For  ArrayList , appending typically involves setting an internal array location to the element reference, but occasionally results in the array being reallocated. For  LinkedList , the cost is uniform and involves allocating an internal  Entry  object.\n",
      "   Inserting or deleting elements in the middle of an  ArrayList  implies that the rest of the list must be moved. Inserting or deleting elements in the middle of a  LinkedList  has fixed cost.\n",
      "   A  LinkedList  does not support efficient random access\n",
      "   An  ArrayList  has space overhead in the form of reserve capacity at the end of the list. A  LinkedList  has significant space overhead per element.\n",
      "   Sometimes a  Map  structure is a better choice than a  List .\n",

In this example, the argument to  toArray  is \"new String[0]\". This argument serves a couple of purposes. First, if you have a  String  array that's big enough to hold the elements of the  ArrayList , you can specify it as the argument to  toArray . The method will use the  String  array.\n",
      "But if your array is not big enough, then the  toArray  method allocates an array to return the elements. It uses the type of the array that was passed in to determine the type of the allocated array.  ArrayList  stores its element references in an  Object  array. The  toArray  method needs to be told if there is some other type (such as String) to be used for returning the array of elements. The method uses reflection ( java.lang.reflect.Array.newInstance ) to create an array of the appropriate type.\n",

      "NO HYPE NO OBLIGATIONIntroducing the Look Good Duo. Our EXCLUSIVE\n",
      "NEW PATENTED PRODUCT is designed to REPAIR SKIN DAMAGE & REJUVENATE TISSUE!\n",
      "Successfully addresses WRINKLES, DARK CIRCLES, AGE SPOTS, FINE LINES, LESIONS, SPIDER VEINS, SKIN TAGS, SCAR TISSUE, CELLULITE, STRETCH MARKS, and MORE for most people the LookGoodDuo is Hypoallergenic !\n",
      "Research, which began many years ago, has concluded that ellagic acid, derived from a compound called ellagitannins, is a very powerful substance. The highest concentration of ellagitannins are found in raspberry seeds. The delivery of the ellagitannins, however, is the key to the effectiveness of the product. We use raspberry seed materials processed using a patented method, which is the ONLY method that guarantees the maximum delivery of available phytoestrogens, polyphenols, and antioxidants.\n",
      "Ellagic acid from raspberry seed ellagitannins is the most powerful and complete polyphenolic, phytoestrogen, antioxidant material yet discovered! These plant based compounds, or phytoestrogens, when absorbed, provide many beneficial effects including stimulation of collagen formation.\n",
      "It is now known that the powerful agents in the raspberry seed materials tone the tiny blood vessels under the eye and decrease the release of the brown chemical pigment. The results are a decrease the appearance of the dark circles under the eyes. These materials also help to decrease the appearance of \"AGE\" brown spots, while smoothing WRINKLES, strengthening HAIR and NAILS, and supporting many other significant health issues!\n",
      "CELLULITE is simply FAT that is tethered down because certain cells in our skin are stimulated by estrogens. The phytoestrogens, polyphenols, and antioxidants from both ORAL and TOPICAL sources of ellagic acid interfere with that tethering process resulting in a smoother skin surface.\n",
      "We offer this Patented material in both a tablet and a topical cream. Taken both internally and externally, it is easy to understand how they can achieve such obvious results so quickly, working from the inside-out AND from the outside-in.  Happy users report a healthy GLOW which they have never achieved with any other product!\n",

      "I've been using the product for a little over a month. I took the \"2 face challenge', and I could tell a difference in only 3 days! The lines on my face and the pores had changed!  I have had people compliment my fingernails. They have been growing like crazy!  C.C., OH\n",
      "This is a unique, one of a kind product.   I have been using it 3 weeks and I can truly see a difference in the liver spots on my hands. The prescription from my dermatologist didn't do it, but this product did.  M.F., MS\n",
      "I have been watching myself very closely, and since using the product, the brown spots on my hand have just about disappeared. The smile lines and the eyelids have really tightened up. No more problems putting my eyeliner on! The skin under my chin has really tightened up.  This is not hard work, it is just sharing the product with family and friends. I have never been rewarded so quickly and so well.   E.P., CA\n",
      "K.D., TX\n",
      "I was queen of skeptical.  I did not want to try this.  I am a 54 yr old grandmother.  I have tried everything for years to get rid of cellulite - the creams, the wraps - nothing worked.  My husband kept telling me to try this.  Finally I did it just to get him off my back.  I had not worn shorts for 5 years.  After about 10 days, my husband started telling me my legs were looking better.  I thought he was just being nice since he got me into this.   Then I went shopping, and in the lights in the dressing room, for the first time in a long time I looked pretty good.  I went into the next dressing room, because I thought the lights were wrong, but I still looked good.  I ended up buying shorts, and have been wearing shorts for the 1st time in 5 years.  Yes, it works!! G.C., TX\n",
      "We just had a booth at the womens expo in Dallas.  Out of the 300 or 400 exhibitors there, the only other spot that had the people we did were the ones giving out free food.   V.C., TX\n",
      "I did the 1 side of the face test, and I did not tell my spouse that I was doing it.  We went to get some  fast food.  He was looking at me, and said I can tell you which side you are using it on.  Its your right side.  I asked what made him think so, and he said the lines around my mouth and eyes have softened, and the fine lines around my neck.  We are tickled, because everyone we talk to wants it!  J.D., TX\n",
